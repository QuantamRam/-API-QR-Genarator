- **No back-end required** because, of course, itâ€™s just JavaScript.
- **Instant gratification**: Click a button, and BAM, QR code. No waiting.
- **Works in any browser**â€”even that weird one your grandma uses. (Looking at you, IE11. Just kidding, IE users. Wait, are there any left?)

## Why use this? ðŸ¤”

Why? Because you need a QR code, thatâ€™s why. And this generator doesnâ€™t ask questions. Itâ€™s simple, efficient, and does exactly one thingâ€”turns your precious text or URLs into a QR code. If you're still reading this, maybe you're procrastinating, so go ahead and clone it already.

## How to Use ðŸ’»
