# API QR Code Generator 🔥

Welcome to **The World's Most Overengineered QR Code Generator** (not really). You wanted to turn some text into a fancy little black-and-white square, and I’m here to make that dream a reality. With just a few lines of code and a dash of JavaScript magic, you’ll be generating QR codes like it’s 1994.

## Features 😎

- **Input anything** (yes, literally anything) and I’ll spit out a QR code.
- **No back-end required** because, of course, it’s just JavaScript.
- **Instant gratification**: Click a button, and BAM, QR code. No waiting.
- **Works in any browser**—even that weird one your grandma uses. (Looking at you, IE11. Just kidding, IE users. Wait, are there any left?)

## Why use this? 🤔

Why? Because you need a QR code, that’s why. And this generator doesn’t ask questions. It’s simple, efficient, and does exactly one thing—turns your precious text or URLs into a QR code. If you're still reading this, maybe you're procrastinating, so go ahead and clone it already.

## How to Use 💻

1. **Clone the repo**, like the pro developer you are:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-generator.git
   Open index.html—yes, it’s that simple. No npm installs, no Docker containers, just open the file. Shocking, right?

Enter your text or URL. Want to see your Wi-Fi password in QR form? Go ahead, no judgment here.

Click the button. Be amazed by the instant QR code. Don’t blame me if you get addicted.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
HTML – Because everything needs a skeleton.

CSS – To make it look somewhat presentable. It’s not ugly, but it’s not winning any beauty contests either.

JavaScript – Because how else will you generate QR codes? With a Sharpie and a ruler?

## Contribute 👨‍💻
